ReactJS v17.0.1
The project uses React 17.0.1 as specified in package.json.

The module is implemented in JavaScript (see all files in src/), but could be migrated to TypeScript if needed.

Sample Data API (POST request)
The API URL is loaded from .env and a POST request is made in useCalendarEvents to fetch events.

Adobe XD Design Guideline
The UI in CalendarModule, EventCard, and EventModal is styled to match the design, using TailwindCSS

Friendly Date/Time Display
Friendly date formatting is handled by friendlyDateString, though EventCard currently implements its own logic. You may want to refactor to use the utility everywhere.

Using TailwindCSS for stylings

Scrollable Description Box
The description in EventModal is in a scrollable area with a custom scrollbar class (custom-scrollbar). You can further style this in CSS.

Download Event as .ICS
ICS file generation and download is handled by useICSExporter, triggered from the modal's "Add to calendar" button.

Default Values for Dynamic Properties
Default values are used throughout the code, e.g., in ICS generation, modal rendering, and event cards.
